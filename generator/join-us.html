<p>You can find all the contact information in <a href="../people/">people</a> or <a href="../contact/">contact</a> pages. Following is a <b>non exhaustive</b> list of oppurtunities.</p>



<ol>
	<li>
		We have ongoing projects using computer vision and AI/ML algorithms. <a href="../research/">Read more</a> and <a href="../contact/">contact the staff members</a> if you want to get involved in an ongoing project. 
	</li>
	<li>
		We are looking for one or more students to explore the validity of the R<sub>0</sub> (reproductivity number) as a parameter to characterize the spread of COVID. We hope to do this study through simulations. We are looking for someone with at least one of the following skills. <br>
		Computer programming, probability/statistics.<br>
		If you are interested, please <a href="../contact">contact Dr. Roshan Godaliyadda</a>.	
	</li>
	<li>
		We are looking for student or a professional with Android development skills to develop a mobile application for tracking contacts. The application should record user movements by GPS and accelerometer data. If you are a student seeking a research oppurtunity, you can collaboarte on the data analytics done by the app. If you are seeking financial compensation, we can discuss a budget for this work. Please <a href="../contact">contact Dr. Vijitha Herath</a> if you are interested.
	</li>
	<li>
		We are looking for a student with a good background in web development and data visualization to help us with building a dashboard to visualize the predictions generated by our algorithms. Even though it is not mandatory, the student is expected to get an exposure about the mathematics behind the predictions in the long run if (s)he wants to get into data science. Please contact <a href="../contact">Dr. Roshan Godaliyadda</a> is you are interested.
	</li>

	<li>
		Utilizing hyperspectral images (HSI) for detecting vulnerable zones for COVID impact. This project will use the aerial imaging / remote sensing techniuques. Contact <a href="../contact">Dr. Roshan Godaliyadda</a> if you are interested.
	</li>

	<li>
		Developing emulation/simulation models for human behavior during COVID outbreaks. This project will use social science insights and mathematial modelling. Contact <a href="../contact">Dr. Vijitha Herath</a> if you are interested.
	</li>

	<li>
		Developing algorithms for optimal testing stratergies, vaccination priority lists and lockdown measures. This project will use simulations, optimization algorithms and predictive algorithms. Contact <a href="../contact/">Dr. Parakrama Ekanayake</a> if you are interested.
	</li>

	<li>
		We are looking for volunteers in conducting surveys and data collection activities. Students without a background in programming/mathematics are also welcome. Contact <a href="../contact/">Dr. Roshan Godaliyadda</a> if you are interested.
	</li>



</ol>

<p>
	<b>Skills required</b>:<br>
	<ul>
	<li>
		Unless specified otherwise, the students are expected to be comfortable in some programming language.</li>
	<li>
		Peradeniya engineering students who have already completed GP106 Computing course can easily get started on a project.<br> If you are from another univeristy, we expect you to have completed at least one undergraduate course focused on programming.</li>
