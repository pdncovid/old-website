    We conduct research in the following thrusts.
    <ol>
        <li id="umar">
            <b>Artificial Intelligence to model and forecast the spread of COVID-19: </b><br>
            We are developing algorithms to predict the COVID-19 case counts, outbreaks and severity on different scenarios. We also attemp to quantify the differential impact of COVID-19 on different communities and individuals.<br><br>
